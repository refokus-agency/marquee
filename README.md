## Publishing

This package uses automated semantic versioning and publishing through GitHub Actions. The release process is triggered automatically on pushes to the `main` branch or manually through GitHub Actions.

### Release Process

1. **Automatic Triggering**: Releases check are triggered on:
   - Push to `main` branch

2. **Environment**: Runs in the `Production` Github repository environment with required permissions
    - Accesess `GH_PAT_TOKEN` secret inside `Production` environment
        - Its value should be a [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with the following access
            - **repo**: all
            - **packages**: all
